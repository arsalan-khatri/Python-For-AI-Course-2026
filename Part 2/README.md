# Python for AI - Course 2026 (Part 2)

Welcome to the **Part 2** of the *Python for AI* series. In this repository, we move beyond the basics and focus on **Automation and Logic Building** the core skills required to build AI Agents and Chatbots.

## What You Will Learn
In this part, we stop manual coding ("Gadha Mazdoori") and start automating tasks using Python's core logic features.

### 1. Dictionaries (The Brain of AI)
Unlike Lists (which use index numbers), Dictionaries use **Key-Value pairs**. This is exactly how AI models like ChatGPT structure their data (JSON format).
- **Concept:** Storing data with labels (e.g., `{"name": "Jarvis"}`).
- **Why it matters:** Essential for handling API responses and complex data.

### 2. Loops (The Engine of Automation)
We cover how to automate repetitive tasks so you don't have to write the same code 100 times.
- **For Loop:** Used for iterating over lists (e.g., processing 100 AI models).
- **While Loop:** The heartbeat of Chatbots (keeps the bot running until you say 'exit').

### 3. Functions (Creating Tools)
How to wrap your code into reusable "tools" so you can call them whenever needed, instead of rewriting code.

### 4. Error Handling (Safety Helmet)
Using `try-except` blocks to prevent your software from crashing when a user enters invalid input.

## Final Project: Smart Quiz Bot
By combining all the concepts above, we built a **Smart Quiz Bot**.
- **Features:** - Asks questions from a dataset (Dictionary).
  - Checks user answers (Logic).
  - Keeps track of the score.
  - Handles invalid inputs safely.
