## About This Part
In this Code, we built the **"Skeleton"** of our Python knowledge. We focused on the **20% most important concepts** that are used in 80% of AI development.

Coding is not about memorizing syntax; it is about knowing **how to store data** and **how to apply logic**.

### What We Covered:
1.  **Variables:** Storing data in memory (Containers).
2.  **Data Types:** Strings (Text), Integers (Numbers), Floats (Decimals).
3.  **Lists:** Storing multiple items in a single container.
4.  **Input/Output:** communicating with the user and printing results.
5.  **F-Strings:** dynamic text formatting.
